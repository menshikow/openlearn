# /openlearn-done

Complete a task and run all 6 Gates for quality verification.

## Important: Permission Required

Before running git commands or updating files:
1. Explain what commands will run
2. Ask: "Should I proceed?"
3. Only continue with explicit confirmation

## Flow

1. **Identify completed work**
   - Ask: "What are you completing?"
     - Task from spec
     - Bug fix
     - Task
     - Refactor
   - Read relevant spec if from active spec

2. **Gather changes** (with permission)
   - Ask: "I'll check git history. Should I run git commands?"
   - If yes:
     - Run `git log --oneline -5`
     - Run `git diff --name-only HEAD~1` or `git status`
   - Ask: "What are the key files to review?"
   - Read the key files

3. **Run 6 Gates sequentially**

   Use `task` tool to invoke each gate agent:
   
   ```
   task(description="Run ownership gate", prompt="@ownership-gate", subagent_type="general")
   ```

   ### Gate 1: @ownership-gate (BLOCKING)
   - Verify student understands their code
   - Score 0-100, must be ≥75%
   - If failed: 
     1. Show score and what needs improvement
     2. Provide study resources
     3. Ask: "Ready to retry with a different question?"
     4. Re-invoke gate with new question
     5. Repeat until passed or student gives up
   
   ### Gate 2: @security-gate (BLOCKING)
   - Review for security issues
   - Score 0-100, must be ≥75%
   - If failed:
     1. Show score and critical issues
     2. Explain security risks
     3. Provide secure coding resources
     4. Ask: "Have you fixed the issues?"
     5. Re-invoke gate for re-review
     6. Repeat until passed or student gives up
   
   ### Gate 3: @error-gate
   - Check error handling
   - Non-blocking, report issues
   
   ### Gate 4: @performance-gate
   - Review performance
   - Non-blocking, report issues
   
   ### Gate 5: @fundamentals-gate
   - Check code quality
   - Non-blocking, report issues
   
   ### Gate 6: @testing-gate
   - Verify test coverage
   - Non-blocking, suggest improvements

4. **Code review summary**
   - Show all gate scores
   - Highlight any blocking failures
   - List non-blocking recommendations

5. **Update spec** (with permission)
   - Ask: "Should I mark the task complete in tasks.md?"
   - If yes: Update tasks.md to mark task complete

6. **Cleanup temporary files**
   - Check `.opencode/openlearn/config.json` for `auto_cleanup_temp_files`
   - If true and temporary files exist in root:
     - Ask: "Remove temporary files (AGENTS.md, PROJECT.md) from root? [Y/n]"
     - If yes: Remove root copies (keep in .opencode/openlearn/)

7. **Show completion summary**
   - ✅ All gates passed OR
   - 🔴 Blocking gates failed - fix and retry

## Implementation Notes

When invoking gates, pass the relevant file paths and context:

```
task(
  description="Run ownership gate",
  prompt="""
  @ownership-gate
  
  Files to review:
  - /path/to/file1.js
  - /path/to/file2.js
  
  Task: [task description]
  """,
  subagent_type="general"
)
```

For blocking gates that fail, implement retry logic:

```
while gate_score < 75:
  ask if ready to retry
  if yes:
    re-invoke gate
  else:
    break and report failure
```
